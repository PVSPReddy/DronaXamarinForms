namespace Effects
{
    public class FocusEffect : RoutingEffect
    {
        public FocusEffect() : base("EffectsTesting.FocusEffect")
        {}
    }
}

RoutingEffect = Class that inherits Effects Class and this connects our custom class with platform-specfic classes/code
base("ResolutionGroupName.EffectName") : this helps the RoutingEffect to understand the name of effets and under which user defined group the current effect comes to effect.
